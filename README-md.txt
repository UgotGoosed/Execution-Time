# Project Title

Write a program that obtains the execution time of selection sort,
bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, and radix sort for input 
size 50,000, 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, 250,000, 300,000.

## Example Output

![Sample Output](README.jpg)

## Analysis Steps

write a program that obtain the execution times of the sort methods.
I would have to create a text class that will run the sort methods.


### Design

I had to create a display for the text.
then create a variable that starts at 50000.

create a method to create a random number array of a certain size.

created a class that has all of the sort methods.

create a for loop that will loop 6 times and calls all sort methods
to sort the arrays.

### Testing

created the display and ran the program, looks good.

created for loop that will run 6 times to generate random arrays to be sorted

created a new class for sort methods
created an array that generates a list of the size needed.
created selection sort method, ran the program, looks good.
created bubble sort method, ran program, looks good.
created merge sort, ran program, looks good.
created quick sort, ran program, looks good.
created heap sort, ran program, looks good.
created radix sort, ran program, looks good.

best sorts were heap and bubble, radix was not bad. Selection sort 
was the worst for sorting large integer arrays.
